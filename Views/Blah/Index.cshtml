            <h3>What I hope to get out of this class</h3>
            <p>I hope to be able to be more comfortable with my programming knowledge. At the same time I also hope to be able to gain the skills to make bigger projects. I've seen ASPNET as one of the skills many employers are looking for. So I hope to be comfortable enough to include it on my resume.</p>
